The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration’s data science capstone project aims to mitigate the critical decline in bee populations by enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of population monitoring techniques by creating an automated classification system. In order to identify specific regions where bee populations are vulnerable, scientists and researchers need an accurate species identification method so they can focus on their efforts to save these essential pollinators that are crucial for ecosystem stability.

Experimenting with both neural networks and landmarking to create the models, this project utilized the promising results of a previous CCBER study on geometric morphometrics in assessing subtle phenotypic differences1. The study analyzed specimens from a reproductively isolated population on Santa Cruz Island and compared them to mainland populations, where significant differentiation in wing venation was identified. These results not only support bee conservation efforts but also expand our understanding of complex geometric variations in nature, offering wider applications in biological research.

The project’s deliverables include:
1) A species identification tool that can identify varying bee species based on wing characteristics with a high accuracy rate (>90%).
2) A thorough investigation into various approaches for quantifying differences in wing morphology, including the use of landmarks and other methods.
3) A reliable wing length measurement tool that provides accurate and consistent results, particularly focusing on images with Aruco markers.
4) A pipeline for standardizing field images, including processes such as perspective correction, cropping, and any other necessary pre-processing steps in order to aid local population research and analysis.
